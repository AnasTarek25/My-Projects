Sentiment Analysis using RNN:
ðŸ§  Sentiment Detection with RNN
This is my first machine learning project focused on sentiment analysis using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The goal is to classify tweets into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. I used a cleaned dataset of tweets and built the model using TensorFlow and Keras. The project covers data preprocessing, tokenization, model training, evaluation, and tuning for better performance. It's been a great hands-on introduction to NLP and deep learning, and I'm excited to continue improving it and exploring more complex models like LSTM and BERT in the future.
